#### Setup
To setup Stitches, use the `createStyled` function. This function receives a [configuration](/docs/configuration) object and returns the following functions:

- `styled`: a function to create React components with styles
- `css`: a function to create themes and SSR styles

Export the `styled` and `css` functions:

```jsx
import { createStyled } from '@stitches/styled';

export const { styled, css } = createStyled({});
```

> Note: From this point onwards, you'll be importing `styled` and `css` from where you've exported it.

#### Configuration
When you setup Stitches, you can customise the following:

```js
createStyled({
  prefix: '',
  tokens: {},
  breakpoints: {},
  utils: {},
});
```

The configuration object accepts the following:

- `prefix`: Optinally add a prefix to all classnames to avoid crashes
- `tokens`: Maps tokens to properties. Learn more about [tokens](/docs/tokens)
- `breakpoints`: Define different `@media` rules. Learn more about [tokens](/docs/breakpoints)
- `utils`: Create your own CSS Properties. Learn more about [utils](/docs/utils)
