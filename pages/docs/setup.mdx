To setup Interop, use the `createStyled` function. This function receives a [configuration](/docs/configuration) object and returns the following functions:

- `styled`: a function to create React components with styles
- `css`: a function to create themes and SSR styles

Export the `styled` and `css` functions:

```jsx
import { createStyled } from '@stitches/react';

const { styled, css } = createStyled({});

export { styled, css };
```

> Note: From this point onwards, you'll be importing `styled` and `css` from where you've exported it.
