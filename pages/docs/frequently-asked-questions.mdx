#### How does Stitches work behind-the-scenes?

Each CSS property in your application is mapped to an atomic class and cached. Once a class is injected, it will never be injected again. From then on, it will just return the same class.

CSS rules are at zero risk of specificity wars. Since every rule gets its own class, the composition is handled at the point of composition, to ensure there are never multiple classes referring to competing properties.

There are no prop interpolations. Changes to styles are defined as `variants` and composed in the consumption layer. This means there are no style re-evaluations at runtime.

The only work Stitches does in terms of evaluation is the first time a unique rule occurs. It creates an atomic class. If it occurs again, the cached class is reused.
