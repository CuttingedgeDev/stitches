You can create theme instances which overrides [tokens](/docs/tokens):

```jsx live manual
const darkTheme = css.theme({
  colors: {
    background: 'black',
    foreground: 'lightgray',
  },
});

render(
  <>
    <div>Default theme</div>
    <div className={darkTheme}>Dark theme</div>
  </>
);
```

The `darkTheme` const represents a classname, which can be added at any point in your application.

You can add multiple themes, which overrides each other by the nested level you apply them.
