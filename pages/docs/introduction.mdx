description: The what and the why of Stitches.

Stitches is a lightweight, performant CSS-in-JS library.

Our goal is to design a more performant styling library with a focus on component architecture and developer experience.

- **Performance**: Stitches avoids unnecessary prop interpolations at runtime, making it significantly more performant than other styling libraries.
- **Server-side rendering**: Stitches supports cross-browser server-side rendering, even for responsive styles and variants.
- **Variants**: Variants are a first-class citizen, so you can design composable component APIs.
- **Theming**: Define multiple themes with CSS variables, then expose them to any part of your app.
- **Specificity**: Due to its atomic output, specificity issues are a thing of the past.
- **Developer experience**: With a fully-typed API, token-aware properties, and custom utils, Stitches provides a fun and intuitive DX.
- **Interoperability**: Stitches components support two-way compatibility with [Modulz](https://modulz.app).

Of course, this all comes alongside the usual benefits that most CSS-in-JS libraries provide, like critical CSS injection and vendor prefixing.
