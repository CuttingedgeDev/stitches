This post is about highlighting the main differences between [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com) and Stitches. Some of these differences are related to the authoring experience. Others are about what happens behind the scenes.

> **Disclaimer**: This post isn't about comparing which one is best. Styled Components and Stitches are two different CSS-in-JS solutions with different concerns.

---

### API Differences

#### Importing `styled` Function

In Styled Components, you can import the `styled` function directly from `styled-components.

In Stitches, you import `styled` from where you've [created the config file](/docs/installation#create-your-config-file).

```jsx
// Styled Components
import { styled } from 'styled-components';

// Stitches
import { styled } from 'stitches.config.js';
```

#### Writing CSS in Object Syntax

In Styled Components, you can write CSS in template strings or in an object syntax.

In Stitches, you write CSS using the [object style](/docs/styling#object-syntax) syntax. The reasons for this are: performance, bundle size and developer experience (type checks and autocomplete suggestions for both properties and values).

```jsx
// Styled Components
const Button = styled.button`
  color: red;
  &:hover {
    color: black;
  }
`;

// Stitches
const Button = styled('button', {
  color: 'red',
  '&:hover': {
    color: 'black',
  },
});
```

#### Interpolating Props

In Styled Components, you can interpolate the component's props to conditionally set styles.

In Stitches, we've introduced the concept of [variants](/docs/variants). You can conditionally apply variants at the consumption level, including at different breakpoints.

```jsx
// Styled Components
const Button = styled.button`
  ${(props) =>
    props.color ===
    'violet'`
    background-color: 'blueviolet'
  `}

  ${(props) =>
    props.color ===
    'gray'`
    background-color: 'gainsboro'
  `}
`;

// Stitches
const Button = styled('button', {
  variants: {
    color: {
      violet: { backgroundColor: 'blueviolet' },
      gray: { backgroundColor: 'gainsboro' },
    },
  },
});

() => <Button color="violet">Button</Button>;
```

#### Adding Theme and Tokens

In Styled Components, you can add a theme via the `<ThemeProvider/>`. The theme gets injected to every component, and you can access it via prop interpolation.

In Stitches, you can [define tokens](/docs/tokens) in the config file and seamlessly consume them in the Style Objects.

```jsx
// Styled Components
import { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components';

() => (
  <ThemeProvider
    theme={{
      tokens: {
        colors: {
          $red500: 'tomato',
        },
        space: {
          $1: '5px',
          $2: '10px',
        },
      },
    }}
  >
    <App />
  </ThemeProvider>
);

const Button = styled.button`
  color: ${props} => props.theme.colors.$red500;
  margin: ${props} => `${props.theme.space.$1} ${props.theme.space.$2}`
`;

// Stitches
const { styled } = createStyled({
  tokens: {
    colors: {
      $red500: 'tomato',
    },
    space: {
      $1: '5px',
      $2: '10px',
    },
  },
});

const Button = styled('button', {
  color: '$red500',
  margin: "$1 $2"
});
```

#### Adding Responsive styles

In Styled Components, you can add at-rules directly in the CSS.

In Stitches, you can do the same. But you can also [define breakpoints](/docs/responsive-styles) in the `breakpoints` object and access directly in the Style Object.

```jsx
// Styled Components
const Box = styled.div`
  padding: 12px;

  @media (min-width: 480px) {
    padding: 24px;
  }
`;

// Stitches
const { styled } = createStyled({
  breakpoints: {
    bp1: (css) => `@media (min-width: 480px) { ${css} }`,
  },
});

const Box = styled('div', {
  padding: '12px',

  bp1: {
    padding: '24px',
  },
});
```

#### Adding Global Styles

In Styled Components, you can add global styles with the `createGlobalStyle` API.

In Stitches, you can use the `css.global` API. Learn more [here](/docs/api#cssglobal).

```jsx
// Styled Components
import { createGlobalStyle } from 'styled-components';

const GlobalStyles = createGlobalStyle`
  body {
    margin: 0
  }
`;

// Stitches
import { css } from './stitches.config';

css.global({
  body: {
    margin: '0',
  },
});
```

#### Animations

In Styled Components, you can import the `keyframes` function directly from `styled-components`.

In Stitches, you can use the `css.keyframes` function.

```jsx
// Styled Components
import { keyframes } from 'styled-components';

const fadeIn = keyframes`
  0% { opacity: 0 }
  100% { opacity: 1 }
`;

const Box = styled.div`
  animation-name: ${fadeIn};
`;

// Stitches
import { css } from 'stitches.config';

const fadeIn = keyframes({
  '0%': { opacity: '0' },
  '100%': { opacity: '1' },
});

const Box = styled('div', {
  animationName: fadeIn,
});
```

#### Server-Side Rendering

In Styled Components, you create `ServerStyleSheet` or the `StyleSheetManager` depending on your needs.

In Stitches, you use the `getStyles` function. Learn more about [server-side rendering](/docs/server-side-rendering).

### Behind the scenes

Stitches is a lightweight, performant styling library with a focus on component architecture and developer experience.

#### Performance

Stitches avoids unnecessary prop interpolations at runtime, making it significantly fast. Each CSS property in your application is mapped to an atomic class and cached. Once a class is injected, it will never be injected again. From then on, it will just return the same class.

Both `@stitches/core` and `@stitches/react` libraries combined weigh in at ~8.0kb gzipped.

#### SSR + Responsive Styles

Many UI libraries document that responsive variants don't work with server-side rendering. Stitches supports cross-browser server-side rendering, even for responsive styles and variants.

#### OOCSS vs Atomic CSS

Styled Components generates Object-Oriented CSS. In other words, it will create a CSS rule per component, containing all of its necessary properties.

Stitches generates Atomic CSS. It creates a single CSS rule for every property. Each property is given its own selector, and they're added as class names to the element.

```jsx
// Styled Components
const Button = styled.button`
  background-color: red;
  color: white;
`;

// Output HTML:
// <button className="hash123" />

// Output CSS:
// .hash123 {
//  backround-color: red;
//  color: white;
// }

// Stitches
const Button = styled('button', {
  backroundColor: 'red',
  color: 'white',
});

// Output HTML:
// <button className="hash123-bg hash123-c" />

// Output:
// .hash123-bg { background-color: red }
// .hash123-c { color: white }
```

#### Developer Experience

Stitches is built on TypeScript. By default, everything you do in Stitches will be type checked. As a user, you'll be suggested autocompletion for CSS Properties, token usage in values, breakpoints and related element attributes. Variants are also typed automatically.

### Wrapping up

When choosing a CSS-in-JS library, keep in mind what your goals are. As demonstrated in this article, both libraries are capable of achieving the same thing, but in different ways.
