Both Stitches and Styled Components are CSS-in-JS libraries. Migrating from Styled Components doesn't involve structural or tooling changes to your code base. Most of the differences are in the styling API.

In this post I'll highlight the main differences between Styled Components and Stitches. I'll show you how you can convert your existing Styled Components to use Stitches instead.

#### Importing `styled` Function

In Styled Components, you can import the `styled` function directly from `styled-components.

In Stitches, you import `styled` from where you've [created the config file](/docs/installation#create-your-config-file).

```jsx
// Styled Components
import { styled } from 'styled-components';

// Stitches
import { styled } from 'stitches.config.js';
```

#### Adding theme

In Styled Components, you can add a theme via the `<ThemeProvider/>`.

In Stitches, you do that via the config file. Learn more in [theming](/docs/theming).

```jsx
// Styled Components
import { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components';

() => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={{}}>
    <App />
  </ThemeProvider>
);

// Stitches
const { styled, css } = createStyled({
  tokens: {},
});
```
