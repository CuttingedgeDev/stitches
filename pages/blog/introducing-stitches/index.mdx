Stitches is a performant styling library with a focus on component architecture and developer experience.

### Performance

#### Performance

At Modulz, performance is paramount. Stitches avoids unnecessary prop interpolations at runtime, making it significantly more performant than other styling libraries.

Each CSS property in your application is mapped to an atomic class and cached. Once a class is injected, it will never be injected again. From then on, it will just return the same class.

The only work Stitches does in terms of evaluation is the first time a unique rule occurs. It creates an atomic class. If it happens again, the cached class is reused.

Both `@stitches/core` and `@stitches/react` libraries combined weigh in at ~8.0kb gzipped.

#### Server-Side Rendering

Stitches supports cross-browser [server-side rendering](/docs/server-side-rendering), even for responsive styles and variants.

### Features

#### Variants

Stitches introduces [variants](/docs/variants) as a first-class citizen, so you can design composable component APIs. Variants can be applied conditionally or responsively.

The ability to define styles based on a combination of variants is also supported. This is known as [compound variants](/docs/variants#compound-variants).

#### Tokens

One of the most loved features of Stitches is the ability to define your own [tokens](/docs/tokens) and seamlessly apply them as CSS values. CSS Properties are automatically mapped to token scales. Tokens can also be used in shorthand CSS properties.

Tokens will be converted to CSS variables.

#### Theming

Stitches supports [themes](/docs/theming). You can create as many as you need, and apply them wherever you want. A theme is a CSS class name which overrides the default tokens.

```jsx
const darkTheme = css.theme({
  colors: {
    $hiContrast: 'hsl(206,2%,93%)',
    $loContrast: 'hsl(206,8%,8%)',

    $gray100: 'hsl(206,8%,12%)',
    $gray200: 'hsl(206,7%,14%)',
    $gray300: 'hsl(206,7%,15%)',
    $gray400: 'hsl(206,7%,24%)',
    $gray500: 'hsl(206,7%,30%)',
    $gray600: 'hsl(206,5%,53%)',
  },
  space: {},
  fonts: {},
});
```

### Utils

Stitches introduces a powerful concept called [utils](/docs/utils). This allows you to create your own CSS Properties, with your own API. Use utils to create powerful combinations of properties, property aliases and to introduce restrictions when needed.

Utils is a great way to create a common language between your team.

```jsx
export const { styled, css } = createStyled({
  utils: {
    marginX: (config) => (value) => ({
      marginLeft: value,
      marginRight: value,
    }),
    marginY: (config) => (value) => ({
      marginTop: value,
      marginBottom: value,
    }),
  },
});
```

#### Responsive

Stitches lets you configure [breakpoints](/docs/responsive-styles) and apply variants responsively. CSS at-rules can also be used inline if needed.

```jsx
export const { styled, css } = createStyled({
  breakpoints: {
    bp1: (rule) => `@media (min-width: 640px) { ${rule} }`,
    bp2: (rule) => `@media (min-width: 768px) { ${rule} }`,
    bp3: (rule) => `@media (min-width: 1024px) { ${rule} }`,
    bp4: (rule) => `@media (min-width: 1280px) { ${rule} }`,
  },
});
```

#### Overrides

Stitches supports a `css` prop on every Stitches Component. You can use this prop to define layout concerns and/or [overrides](/docs/overriding-styles). Tokens and breakpoints also work here.

```jsx
<Button css={{ backgroundColor: 'red' }}>Button</Button>
```

#### Developer Experience

One of the main goals of Stitches is to provide the best possible developer experience. When using TypeScript, CSS Properties, values, breakpoints will be auto-completed for you.

Stitches Components support an `as` prop too. This is a polymorphic prop. If you change the type of element, the prop suggestions will update.

### A quick tutorial

#### 1. You install it

```bash
npm install @stitches/react
```

#### 2. Set it up

```jsx
import { createStyled } from '@stitches/react';

export const { styled, css } = createStyled({
  tokens: {
    colors: {
      $gray100: 'hsl(206,22%,99%)',
      $gray200: 'hsl(206,12%,97%)',
      $gray300: 'hsl(206,11%,92%)',
      $gray400: 'hsl(206,10%,84%)',
      $gray500: 'hsl(206,10%,76%)',
    },
    space: {
      $1: '5px',
      $2: '10px',
      $3: '15px',
    },
    fontSizes: {
      $1: '12px',
      $2: '13px',
      $3: '15px',
    },
  },
});
```

#### 3. And use it

```jsx live manual
const Button = styled('button', {
  backgroundColor: '$gray300',
  borderRadius: '9999px',
  fontSize: '$2',
  lineHeight: '1',
  fontWeight: 500,
  padding: '$2 $3',
  border: '0',

  '&:hover': {
    backgroundColor: '$gray500',
  },
});

render(<Button>Button</Button>);
```
